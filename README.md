# training-gesture-with-tflite
This repository demonstrates training an hand gesture recognition model using sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope). The data is pre-processed, normalized, and used to train a model with TensorFlow. s then converted to TensorFlow Lite for efficient deployment on embedded devices.
